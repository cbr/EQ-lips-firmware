* On first run, init EEPROM banks
* Font with big char for bank number
*

====== OLD ITEMS =======

* Fix IDF/FSR bank access (with bankisel and other things)

* Manage stomp switch. Proposition:
** Stomp switch 1: bypass, hardware only
** Stomp switch 2:
         short:
              - in select mode : previous bank with activation
              - in no_select mode: select current bank
         long: enter in no_select mode, change to previous bank with blink
** Stomp switch 3:
         short:
              - in select mode : next bank with activation
              - in no_select mode: select current bank
         long: enter in no_select mode, change to next bank with blink

  ==> NO ! It needs timer, and because of sound "ticks" we prefer to stay in sleep mode.


* Manage generic bank module
** Save bank in flash if enough flash mem is available

* Tremolo: eq and simple are now working. However, eq trem result is not very interresting.

* Sound problem with tremolo: presence of "tic"
** Facts:
*** When a same value is sent continiously on SPI -> No problem:
*** The proble can be heard when a DIFFERENT value is sent.
*** It seams that the problem only occurs on global gain, not for eq band -> in fact no: it can also be heard on eq
    band, but it is less sensitive
*** By changing the cpu clock the problem is still present
*** When CS of numpot is 'in the air' the signal is very noisy. -> CS problem ?
** TODO:
*** Simulate the fact that there is another chained numpot after the gain numpot.
==> Maybe it is an alim pb ? As workaround, tremolo is deactivated
