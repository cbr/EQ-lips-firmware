         short:
              - in select mode : previous bank with activation
              - in no_select mode: select current bank
         long: enter in no_select mode, change to previous bank with blink
** Stomp switch 3:
         short:
              - in select mode : next bank with activation
              - in no_select mode: select current bank
         long: enter in no_select mode, change to next bank with blink
